# TaiBIF Open Data Toolkit (TaiBIF ODT)

## Overview

The toolkit is specifically designed for processing biodiversity open data, following the [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) standard. It encompasses four key stages:  
**1. Creating a data template ‚Üí 2. Editing data ‚Üí 3. Validating datasets ‚Üí 4. Cleaning data.**

Developed by **TaiBIF (Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility)**, this toolkit helps biodiversity data providers ‚Äî especially Mandarin-speaking users ‚Äî to streamline dataset preparation and meet global publishing standards like GBIF through [IPT (Integrated Publishing Toolkit)](https://ipt.gbif.org/).

## Features

- üß© **Template Generator**  
  Quickly build data structures for different dataset types: Checklist, Occurrence and Sampling Event.

- üìù **Spreadsheet-like Editing Interface**  
  Offers intuitive editing similar to Excel, with filtering, autofill, and inline validation.

- ‚úÖ **Darwin Core Validator**  
  Checks for missing required fields, field name mismatches, and improper values based on GBIF rules.

- üßπ **Data Cleaning Tools**  
  Includes features similar to OpenRefine for handling typos, formatting inconsistencies, and value standardization.

- üì¶ **Darwin Core Archive Export**  
  Cleaned and validated data can be packaged into a `.zip` archive ready for IPT upload.
